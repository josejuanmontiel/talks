=== What is Spock ?

[%step]
* Testing and specification framework for **Java** and **Groovy**
* Do your app in Java/Groovy and do the testing in Groovy
* JUnit runner based (IDE friendly)
* A **highly expressive specification language**

=== What Spock has to do with this ?

[%step]

- It has a **+++<u>template system</u>+++** to give you extra **+++<u>feedback</u>+++**
