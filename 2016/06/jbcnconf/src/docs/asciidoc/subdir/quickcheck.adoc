**A Lightweight Tool for Random Testing of Haskell Programs**

=== +++<span class="no_tests"></span>+++

=== Facts they observed:

[%step]
* Around the +++<u>50% of the software</u>+++ development was dedicated to +++<u>testing</u>+++.
* That was a +++<u>huge cost</u>+++ and mostly due to the fact that it was done
  almost +++<u>manually</u>+++.
* The goal was to +++<u>reduce</u>+++ that percentage +++<u>by automating</u>+++ testing.

=== Ideas:

[%step]
- Don't just test code, +++<u>check properties</u>+++
- Don't create values, +++<u>generate them</u>+++
- +++<u>Feedback</u>+++, feedback, feedback
- Tell me +++<u>how to refute</u>+++ the test

=== QuickCheck in Java ?
