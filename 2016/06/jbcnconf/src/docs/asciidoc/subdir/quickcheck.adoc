=== Facts they observed:

[%step]
* Around the **+++<u>50% of the software</u>+++** was **+++<u>testing</u>+++**.
* That was a **+++<u>huge cost</u>+++** because it was done almost **+++<u>manually</u>+++**.
* The goal was to **+++<u>reduce</u>+++** that percentage **+++<u>by automating</u>+++** testing.

=== Ideas:

[%step]
- Don't just test code, check **+++<u>properties</u>+++**
- Don't create values, **+++<u>generate</u>+++** them
- **+++<u>Feedback</u>+++**, feedback, feedback
- Tell me how to **+++<u>refute</u>+++** the test
