== Until...

That's what Koen Claessen and John Hughes thought in 2000 when they
published...

=== QuickCheck

**A Lightweight Tool for Random Testing of Haskell Programs**

=== Facts they observed:

[%step]
* Around the 50% of the software development was dedicated to testing.
* That was a huge cost and mostly due to the fact that it was done
  almost manually.
* The goal was to reduce that percentage by automating testing.

=== Ideas:

[%step]
- Don't just test code, check properties
- Don't create values, generate them
- Feedback, feedback, feedback
- Tell me how to refute the test
