== Properties

[%step]
* They specify **what you expect** of your program and can be executed
against the program to ensure that it conforms to the spec
* **Executable specifications** which means...
* ...**a function that holds** for a set of values **using the program (function or set of functions) you want to test**.

=== A simple function

[source,groovy]
.SimpleProperty.java
----
include::{javaMain}/properties/SimpleProperty.java[tags=sum]
----

=== Spock first

[source,groovy]
.SumCheckCodeSpec.groovy
----
include::{groovyTest}/properties/SumCheckCodeSpec.groovy[tags=commutative]
----

=== But...

[%step]
- Some key test numbers may be wrong or missing
- ...and they are
- But the more cases I add the more verbose the test becomes
- There's no clear what are the properties the function **SUM** must hold

=== A property

[%step]
* **Commutative property**:
* **when**: 'two numbers are added,'
* **then**: 'the sum is the same'
* **and**:  'regardless of the order of the addends'

=== Spock first...property

[source,groovy]
.SumCheckPropertiesSpec.groovy
----
include::{groovyTest}/properties/SumCheckPropertiesSpec.groovy[tags=commutative]
----

=== Nice

[%step]
* The property defined is perfectly clear
* I'm removing unnecessary test logic

=== But

[%step]
* Some numbers could be still missing
* I can't be adding a 100 numbers on each test right ?
* ...or can I ?
* It would be nice to have those numbers generated :)
